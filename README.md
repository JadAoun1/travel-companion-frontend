* Replace current dropdown for adding users to a trip with a searchable input field allowing users to search by usernames to easily add others to their trips. 
* Refactor MapView.jsx to lift state so that Google Maps Places (New) API data can be rendered elsewhere.
* Build out models to incorporate more data within the UI (including, but not limited to user profiles, and destination/attraction details)
* Incorporate in-app messaging system so users assigned to the same trip can communicate. 
* Show multiple markers on trip and destination show page maps. 
* Utilize more capababilities of the Google Maps Places (New) API to allow users to find additional nearby attractions.

* **[git revert vs reset](https://medium.com/@halilatilla/git-revert-and-reset-understanding-their-purpose-and-differences-d11a913e288)**: This project was a crash course in github collaboration so we utilized git reset on multiple occasions to get to our last working version.
* **[Google API docs](https://developers.google.com/maps)**: Anna learned firsthand just how hard these docs are to navigate (pun intended).
* **[How to Implement Google Places API in Your Application (JS, Express, Node.js)](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-implement-google-places-api-in-your-application-js-express-node-js-97b16da24835)**: This was a super brief overview of how to implement Google Places API. The research that followed reading this article included a deep rabbit hole of guides that required Typescript translation into Javascript, lots of chatGPT prompts like, "Can you explain _____ concept when implementing Google Maps API?", and many YouTube tutorials. 
* **[SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73359274/syntaxerror-unexpected-token-doctype-is-not-valid-json)**: This was just one of many resources we used when getting this error message (which happened far more than we would have liked). 
* **[Full React Tutorial by Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHaECbrKgs0)**: And other YouTube tutorials refreshing our understanding of React.
* **[React DOM Components](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components)**: This resource was used to understand form components and how to use select in different ways.  
* **[StackOverflow: Generate options by mapping over array of objects with react-select ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55173409/generate-options-by-mapping-over-array-of-objects-with-react-select/55173797#55173797)**: This helped understand how to generate select options by mapping over an array so users can be seen in a dropdown.  
* **[GeeksforGeeks: Mongoose Populate Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongoose-populate-method/)**: This helped give a better understanding on the .populate() method and how to use it to retrieve data in queries. 
* **[MDN: .toString() Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString)**: This filled learning gaps and helped in understanding how the toString() method works, and how it can be used in different parts of the code to convert values to strings.
* **[General Assembly Hoot Front-End](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/react-hoot-front-end/setup/)**: Helped with initial front end set-up. 
* **[General Assembly Hoot Back-End](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/express-api-hoot-back-end/create-hoot/)**: Helped with initial back-end set up for routes 
* **[General Assembly JWT-Auth in React](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/jwt-authentication-in-react/setup/)**: This lecture helped setup user authorization and JWT token based authentication to signup, signin, and signout.
* **[How To Manage User Roles In Node.js â€“ Web Dev Simplified:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI4K7L-LI58&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)**: This video helped to understand how to add roles to different users and control what they have access to.
